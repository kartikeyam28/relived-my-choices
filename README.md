## Google Gemini API Setup

This project uses Google Gemini AI for regret analysis. 

**To configure the API key:**

1. **Get your API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

2. **Set up your environment variable:**
   - Open the `.env.local` file in the project root
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
     ```
     VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Restart the dev server** if it's running

**Note:** The `.env.local` file is already gitignored, so your API key won't be committed to version control.
